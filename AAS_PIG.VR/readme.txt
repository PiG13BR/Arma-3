SECTOR CONTROL (AAS STYLE)

This is just a template of a small and comestic modification of the sector control gametype by Bohemia Interactive Studio based on BF2:Project Reality, where the teams have to capture a sector to "unlock" the next one.
Tested and working on dedicated server.

Changes:
- Comestic sector attack and defend markers for each side.
- The team cannot capture foward sectors like in normal SC. The player will detect the sector in their hud but cannot capture it if the sector is not under an "attack marker".
